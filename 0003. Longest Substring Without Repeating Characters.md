Method 1:
Get the length of longest substring by finding substrings using each of
the element in s as the beginning of a substring. Then, keep the bigger length
between originally kept length and new length.

Time complexity: O(N^2)
Space complexity: O(N)

class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        def substring_length(index):
            substring = set()
            while index < len(s) and s[index] not in substring:
                substring.add(s[index])
                index += 1
            return len(substring)
        
        result = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if substring_length(i) > result:
                result = substring_length(i)
        return result
```
